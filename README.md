Stored Procedures and Functions: The project includes stored procedures and functions that involve complex logic across multiple tables.
Advanced SQL Techniques: Utilizes cursors, collections, and bulk processing to handle large datasets efficiently.
Exception Handling: Robust exception handling mechanisms are in place to ensure smooth operation and error management.
Modular Code Structure: The code is organized into packages that group related procedures, functions, constants, and exceptions.
Thorough Testing: All procedures and functions are tested using anonymous PL/SQL blocks, ensuring their reliability and correctness.
Well-Documented Code: Each package, procedure, and function is documented with comments, providing clarity on its purpose and implementation.
